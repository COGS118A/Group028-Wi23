    "# Abstract \n",
    "We will investigate the connection between features of a movie and its rating on the popular movie reviews website Rotten Tomatoes. This website classifies each movie as one of three categories: rotten, fresh, and certified fresh. We plan to use the non-cinematic features of movies to classify them into one of these three categories. Each data point will represent a movie and many of its characteristics. These features include things like director, genre, a synopsis, runtime, actors, etc. Almost all of these features are nominal or interval. We will be performing classification on our test data to predict the Rotten Tomatoes status of a movie. The status includes the aforementioned three categories. For model selection, we will perform grid-search cross validation and select the model with the best generalization. Since neither false positives nor false negatives pose more risk than the other in the context of our problem, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our model primarily using its f1 score, as this provides a metric that balances the impact of false negatives and false positives.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotten tomatoes is a popular website many people use to look at movie ratings. It provides an overall freshness score for movies based on the percentage of positive reviews. Scores can be assigned to either rotten(<60%), fresh(>60%), and certified fresh rating(>75% + 5 top critic reviews). They also provide an audience score. (https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/rotten-tomatoes-ratings-system/) We want to classify movies into rotten, fresh, and certified fresh categories. \n",

We see that some genres like horror, comedy, mystery, and action perform much lower than other high-performing genres like documentary, classics, and animation. We expect that our Machine Learning algorithm should end up influenced by this reality. \n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We predict that these features, while not completely evident in the content of the movie, will be a large predictor of the movie’s rating. More specifically, we predict that the director will have a large influence on the overall rating given to the movie. Additionally, we predict that certain genres will be rated more highly than others across the board. We believe that a classification model will be able to effectively find a connection between director and rating and genre and rating. We will test each solution using our selected metric: the f1 score of a model. We believe that there is a connection to discover between these non-cinematic characteristics and the rating of the movie, whether it is a large connection or small connection, and therefore believe that a classification model will be able to effectively identify this connection.\n"

One consideration we are taking into account is that this dataset has the names of all the movie reviewers in it, which could be an ethical concern if we include their names in our analysis. We’re going to avoid that though by completely ignoring the names of the critics and dropping it from the data since their names are irrelevant to our project. "
