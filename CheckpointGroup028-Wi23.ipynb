    "# Abstract \n",
    "We will investigate the connection between features of a movie and its rating on the popular movie reviews website Rotten Tomatoes. This website classifies each movie as one of three categories: rotten, fresh, and certified fresh. We plan to use the non-cinematic features of movies to classify them into one of these three categories. Each data point will represent a movie and many of its characteristics. These features include things like genre, release date, runtime, etc. Almost all of these features are nominal or interval. We will be performing classification on our test data to predict the Rotten Tomatoes status of a movie. The status includes the aforementioned three categories. For model selection, we will perform grid-search cross validation and select the model with the best generalization. Since neither false positives nor false negatives pose more risk than the other in the context of our problem, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our model primarily using its f1 score, as this provides a metric that balances the impact of false negatives and false positives.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Movie ratings are an important aspect of the film industry, with many consumers relying on them to guide their viewing decisions. Rotten Tomatoes is a popular website that provides ratings based on the percentage of positive reviews for a given movie. These ratings are divided into three categories: rotten for scores below 60%, fresh for scores above 60%, and certified fresh for scores above 75% and at least 5 top critic reviews. Additionally, the website includes an audience score as a separate metric<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>. Despite the popularity of such rating systems, recent research has raised questions about their accuracy in reflecting the opinions of the general public.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recent study<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\"><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">[2]</a></sup>, researchers found that movie rating scores on Rotten Tomatoes do not necessarily align with the sentiment of audience reviews. This highlights the need for a more nuanced approach to understanding audience preferences. Furthermore, movie popularity can vary significantly across genres, with certain genres like horror, comedy, mystery, and action performing poorly compared to others such as documentary, classics, and animation<sup id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup>. These differences in popularity may impact the effectiveness of a machine learning algorithm trained on movie ratings data, suggesting the need for careful consideration of genre in the analysis.\n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that our project is trying to solve is predicting the rotten tomatoes rating for a movie based on movie features including genre, release date, runtime, and content rating. We will do this by using machine learning algorithms like a random forest classifier and logistic regression to predict if a movie will receive a \"fresh\" rotten tomato score or a \"rotten\" score. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we use makes this very much quantifiable, although certain variables are categorical and must therefore be either one-hot encoded or ordinally encoded so that we can work with it mathematically. We will divide our dataset up into 2/3 training data and 1/3 testing data and then use the metric of \"Precision\" to determine the success of our algorithm. "

    "We predict that these features, while not completely evident in the content of the movie, will be a large predictor of the movie’s rating. More specifically, we predict that the director will have a large influence on the overall rating given to the movie. Additionally, we predict that certain genres will be rated more highly than others across the board. We believe that a classification model will be able to effectively find a connection between director and rating and genre and rating. We will test each solution using our selected metric: the f1 score of a model. We believe that there is a connection to discover between these non-cinematic characteristics and the rating of the movie, whether it is a large connection or small connection, and therefore believe that a classification model will be able to effectively identify this connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifiers we have tested are support vector machines, logistic regression, and random forest. There are a two things to consider when selecting our model. We must consider the ability of the model to approximate more complex functions, and we must consider the interpretability of the classifier. SVMs, while powerful are not very interpretable. Logistic Regression is less powerful, but more interpretable. \n",
    "\n",
    "After performing grid search cross-validation on these three algorithms, we are most interested in using a random forest classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are looking to discover an inherent connection between certain features of our data, we would like to select the most interpretable model. However, because model interpretability scales inversely with model capacity (the amount of functions a model can approximate), we have to balance these two characteristics. Because we need to find a good medium, we are looking into using a random forest classifier. Random forest classifiers comprise many decision trees. Decision trees are some of the most interpretable classifiers available for use. Additionally, because random forests are ensemble learners, it's acceptable to use a less complex model (decision trees, in this case). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a random forest classifier allows us to get the best of both worlds. Our model will have high interpretability, as well as a high model capacity and high prediction ability."

A false negative would have little effect when actually using our model in practice, as filmmakers rarely have the intention of making a bad movie.
